# Salesforce-Formstack-Custom-Javascript
If you are using Formstack in your org and need more control on the form, you can easily custom behaviors with Javascript. You will find in this repo some sample codes on how to enhance Formstack with custom logic. 
Based on where your Formstack form is hosted (Experience... 'cough cough Community', or Salesforce.com), the syntax will slightly change. 
You could, for example: 
- verify the formatting of a phone number, 
- show/hide an entire section based on the entered Birth date, 
- raise custom errors based on the content of the form, 
- check selected value of a dropdown and update content based on the selected value, 
- enable/disable the next button every time a field is filled out/changed, 
- apply/remove css class to fields when ever something happens. 

Your imagination is the limit.
